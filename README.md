# Personal Website
Repository for my Personal Website

The website can be found at:  https://ehpropp.github.io/Personal-Website/

To create this website I followed a tutorial by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media on YouTube. The link first video of the tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzHS-n2gqU&list=PLCVx6Ss6-wUV8C6XEy7_m0d4JpdvP2d_0&index=15&t=0s).

The tutorial used npm from Node.js to make use of sass for the design.

If you like the website or have any tips on how I could make it better, let me know. I'd love to hear some advice on this, as this is the first website I've made.
